Another little bit PS script....
In summary, this PowerShell command queries the scheduled tasks on a Windows system, extracts specific properties (Taskname and RunAsUser), and filters the results to include only tasks where the "RunAsUser" contains the string "domain-account-as-a-service." It then displays the filtered results in a list format. This can be useful for identifying specific scheduled tasks that run under a particular user context.
